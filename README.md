## READ ME

  Mid-way through creating my portfolio i ended up doing more research on modern wesites and enjoyed the super minimalistic approach.

  I think it works better in terms of a business/portfolio as it looks clean and professional.

  I will want to in future add more interesting components like potentially a little web browser game implemented into my code somewhere, I enjoyed the example of this as it was engaging!! Did some looking into that one website and like it a lot so I may try my hand at that in the future.

  In this website I was able to use a lot of the concepts that we have been learning recently, I am proud of myself for getting them to work as I feel like I have struggled with the understanding protion!

## PLAN

- [x] Biography/Self-Intro - a paragraph or two about you.

- [x] Tech Stack - the languages/technologies that you have experience with. this is going in experience when i expand on it

- [x] Education / Experience - only those that are relevant to coding / the line of work you want to go into.

- [x] Projects - sites/apps that you have built.
